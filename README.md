Put vehicles on a trailer and securily transport them.

## How it works
!Currently just working with the big-trailer (modelname = tr2)!

Just get in a truck and hitch up a tr2 trailer. Now you can go to the rear of the trailer and press E. There you can open and close the ramp or the plateau. Then just drive any car onto the trailer, and go once again to the rear end of the trailer to secure the cars. After you closed the ramp and drove around for a while, you can detach the vehicles by unsecuring them in the menu mentioned before.

## Features
- Opening and closing the ramp and plateau
- securing and unsecuring loaded vehicles
- server sync (one person can load the cars an other person can unload them without issues)
- English and German language

## Things I will add in the future
- Support for more trailers

If you find any issues feel free to let me know. If you have any suggestions just let me know to

If you want that you dont have to drive the cars on the trailer, but rather they should snap on the trailer on preconfigured positions, I suggest you check out this nice resource:
